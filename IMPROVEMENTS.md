# SOE Web Viewer Future Improvements

## Quick Wins
- [ ] Dark/Light mode toggle
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Escape to close, `/` to focus search)
- [ ] Recently viewed items/NPCs (last 5-10, stored in localStorage)
- [ ] Deep-link URLs (`/npcs/123`) for browser back button support

## Data Display
- [ ] Item sprites on cards (use GFX resources)
- [ ] Drop rate visualization (colored bars: green=common, red=rare)
- [ ] Stat comparison for equipment (vs localStorage "equipped" items)
- [ ] Quest chain/tree view (prerequisites → current → follow-ups)

## Navigation
- [ ] Breadcrumbs trail (NPC → Quest → Item path)
- [ ] Related content ("Similar items" same type, ±5 levels)
- [ ] Map preview images for spawn locations

## Performance
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists (if pagination removed)

## Mobile
- [ ] Responsive modal improvements
- [ ] Swipe gestures for list navigation
